Only clothing adapts - FACE, LIPS, HAIR are perfect copies.\n\nPET/DOG FIDELITY: Preserve exact dog breed characteristics, face shape, snout length, nose color and texture, eye shape, eye color, ear shape, fur color, fur pattern, fur texture from input photo. Keep exact breed identity - NO changes to dog's facial features or breed characteristics.\n\nTEETH CLARITY (CRITICAL): Dog's teeth must be ultra-realistic, sharp, clear, and highly detailed - visible individual teeth with natural spacing, realistic enamel texture, natural dog tooth shape and color. No blurry teeth, no merged teeth, no cartoon teeth.\n\nBlack and white intimate portrait: Woman and golden retriever/labrador facing each other in side profile, noses must be clear, smooth, distant. Woman on right side smiling warmly with genuine happy expression, eyes looking at dog with love. Dog on left side with mouth naturally open showing clear detailed teeth, happy relaxed expression, looking toward woman. Woman's nose, lips and teeth must be very clear. Both profiles clearly visible.\n\nClose intimate framing, soft focus background, sharp focus on both faces. Soft studio lighting, gentle shadows, natural skin texture on woman, realistic detailed fur texture on dog. Emotional connection, tender moment, pure love between pet and owner.\n\n9:16 vertical, monochrome photography, photorealistic, professional portrait quality, ultra-detailed teeth and facial features, 8K quality."
